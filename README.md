# 3D Scene Project Reflection

# How do I approach designing software?
Working on this 3D scene project taught me several new design skills. I learned how to break down complex real-world objects into basic geometric shapes and plan their assembly before writing any code. The chair, for example, required me to visualize how cylinders, boxes, and careful rotations would combine to create something recognizable.

My design process started with analyzing my reference image and sketching out which primitive shapes I'd need. Then I planned the transformation hierarchy, figuring out positions, rotations, and scales before implementing them. I also learned to design reusable material and lighting systems early, which made the actual scene building much smoother.
These tactics are applicable to future work. Breaking problems into smaller components, planning before coding, and designing reusable systems are universal software development principles. Whether I'm building a game, simulation, or any other application, this structured approach will help me stay organized and efficient.

# How do I approach developing programs?

I used several new development strategies for this 3D scene. The biggest one was creating modular functions like SetTransformations(), SetShaderTexture(), and SetShaderMaterial(). Instead of repeating transformation calculations for every object, I built reusable functions that made my code cleaner and easier to debug.

Iteration was huge in my development process. I didn't build everything at once. I started with the floor plane, then added the chair piece by piece—first the legs, then the frame, then the cushions. Each time I added something, I'd test it, adjust positions and scales, and make sure it looked right before moving on. The record player was especially iterative. I built the base, then the turntable, then the tonearm, tweaking each component until they fit together properly.

My approach evolved significantly through the milestones. Early on, I was writing repetitive code and manually calculating every transformation. By the end, I was thinking in terms of reusable functions and organized systems. I learned to separate concerns, like materials in one function, lighting in another, transformations handled consistently. This made debugging easier and the final code much more maintainable.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computational graphics and visualizations give me practical skills that apply across many fields. Understanding 3D coordinate systems, transformations, and rendering pipelines helps me think spatially and mathematically. These concepts appear in game development, simulation software, data visualization, virtual reality, and even web development with WebGL.

The problem-solving approach I developed, breaking complex visuals into manageable components, debugging rendering issues, optimizing performance, transfers directly to other programming challenges. Learning to work with shaders, textures, and lighting also taught me about GPU programming and parallel processing concepts.

Professionally, these skills open doors in game development, visualization software, simulation (which I do now), and interactive media. Even if I don't work directly in graphics, the mathematical thinking and systematic approach to complex problems will serve me well. Additionally using Visual Studio in this course has opened the path for future projects or improvements using this platform. The ability to create visual representations of data or concepts is valuable in almost any technical field. Plus, having a portfolio piece that demonstrates I can build a complete, polished 3D application shows potential employers that I can see projects through from concept to completion.
